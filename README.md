# Engine-q

Engine-q is an experimental project to replace the core functionality in Nushell (parser, engine, protocol). It's still in an alpha state, and there is still a lot to do: please see TODO.md

If you'd like to help out, come join us on the [discord](https://discord.gg/NtAbbGn) or propose some work in an issue or PR draft. We're currently looking to begin porting Nushell commands to engine-q.

If you are interested in porting a command from Nushell to engine-q you are welcome to
[comment on this issue 242](https://github.com/nushell/engine-q/issues/242) with the command name you would like to port.
